Introduction {#intro}
=====================

CSS <a>custom properties</a> enable authors to define reusable values,
give them names,
then invoke them throughout the stylesheet.
This makes it easy to keep a page's theme consistent when changes are made,
because the theming values are defined in a central place.

But <a>custom properties</a> can hold more than just values--
they can also be used to hold sets of declarations.
The ''@apply'' rule takes these sets of declarations and inlines them in another style rule,
serving a purpose analogous to what the ''var()'' function does for individual values.

<div class=note>

	There are many ways to apply sets of declarations to an element.
	In particular, the common way is to just create a style rule,
	and apply it to the desired elements via a selector.
	However, this requires the elements you wish to target to already have the right features for a selector,
	or else you have to alter your markup,
	or write a complex selector that targets them precisely with their varied features
	(and which needs to be maintained as you alter the page markup and change the selectors targetting those elements).
	This also requires careful management of specificity,
	as the rule has to interact with the existing rules styling the elements.

	The ''@apply'' rule allows this reuse to be inlined into the existing selectors you're already using,
	reducing the amount of effort required to keep your stylesheet consistent as things change in the page.
	It also avoids the need to manage specificity any more than you already do,
	as the properties are inlined alongside the existing properties,
	in your existing style rules.
</div>


Defining Custom Sets of Properties {#defining}
==============================================

To define a <dfn export>custom property set</dfn> for use with ''@apply'',
you simply use a <a>custom property</a>
with a value of a {}-wrapped block of properties.

<div class='example'>
	For example, one might define a toolbar theme as a <a>custom property set</a> on the root element of the document,
	and use it on your toolbars:

	<pre class="lang-css">
		:root {
			--toolbar-theme: {
				background-color: hsl(120, 70%, 95%);
				border-radius: 4px;
				border: 1px solid var(--theme-color late);
			};
			--toolbar-title-theme: {
				color: green;
			};
		}

		.toolbar {
			@apply --toolbar-theme;
		}
		.toolbar > .title {
			@apply --toolbar-title-theme;
		}
	</pre>

	Then, we can override the theme for toolbars inside of "warning" elements:

	<pre class="lang-css">
		.warning {
			--toolbar-title-theme: {
				color: red;
				font-weight: bold;
			};
		}
	</pre>

	We don't have to worry about the internal structure of the toolbars,
	or precisely what internal elements use the styles.
	Simply overriding the <a>custom property</a> will automatically do the right thing.
</div>

<div class="example">
	Note that <a>custom property sets</a> override each other wholly,
	rather than cascading together like colliding <a>style rules</a> do.

	For example, if these two style rules applied to the same element:

	<pre class="lang-css">
		.foo {
			color: red;
			background: white;
		}
		#bar {
			color: blue;
		}
	</pre>

	The ''#bar'' rule will win due to having a higher specificity,
	so its ''color:blue'' rule will apply to the element,
	but the ''background:white'' rule from the ''.foo'' rule also applies,
	since the ''#bar'' rule did not override 'background'.

	However, if these were instead defined as <a>custom property sets</a>:

	<pre class="lang-css">
		.foo {
			--my-theme: {
				color: red;
				background: white;
			};
		}
		#bar {
			--my-theme: {
				color: blue;
			};
		}
	</pre>

	Then when an element uses the '--my-theme' <a>custom property set</a>,
	it will receive <em>only</em> the ''color:blue'' declaration.
	The ''background:white'' declaration from the ''.foo'' rule is ignored completely,
	as its rule lost the specificity battle.
</div>

Issue: Need some way to let you opt into cascading when you want it.

Changes to Custom Property Processing {#processing-change}
----------------------------------------------------------

If the value of a <a>custom property</a> contains an ''@apply'' rule,
the ''@apply'' rule must be valid according to the specified ''@apply'' grammar.
If not, the <a>custom property</a> is invalid and must be ignored.

''@apply'' rules in <a>custom property</a> values are substituted at <a>computed value</a> time,
identically to ''var()'' functions.

For this purpose, an ''@apply'' rule is composed of a sequence of tokens
starting with the ''@apply'' token,
and ending at (and including) the first same-level semicolon,
the end of the <a>simple block</a> the ''@apply'' token is in,
or the end of the <a>custom property's</a> value.

The computed value of a <a>custom property</a>

Using Custom Sets of Properties: the ''@apply'' rule {#using}
=============================================================

Once a <a>custom property set</a> has been declared,
the ''@apply'' rule inlines it into a style rule.
It's syntax is:

	<pre class=prod>
		<dfn at-rule>@apply</dfn> = @apply <<custom-property-name>> ;
	</pre>

The ''@apply'' rule is only valid inside of a style rule.
Using it outside of a style rule,
or inside any other rule,
is invalid and causes the ''@apply'' to be ignored.

<div class="example">
	Here's a valid example of ''@apply'' usage:

	<pre class="lang-css">
		.foo {
			color: blue;
			@apply --foo-styles;
		}
	</pre>

	Here's several invalid example of ''@apply'' usage:

	<pre class="lang-css invalid">
		.foo {
			color: blue;
		}

		@apply --top-level-is-invalid;
	</pre>

	<pre class="lang-css invalid">
		@keyframes foo {
			from { color: red; }
			to { color: blue; }
			@apply --this-is-not-a-style-rule;
		}
	</pre>
</div>

For the purposes of the <a>cascade</a>,
the ''@apply'' rule must be treated as if it were replaced by the properties
in the <a>custom property set</a> that is the value of the <a>custom property</a> it references.

Note: Within the CSSOM, the ''@apply'' rule is not replaced;
examining the style rule will show it as having the ''@apply'' rule in its <code>.childRules</code> attribute,
and the properties in the <a>custom property set</a> will not be visible in any way.

If the <a>custom property</a> that the ''@apply'' rule references
does not define a valid <a>custom property set</a>,
the ''@apply'' rule is treated, for the purposes of the cascade, as if it were replaced with nothing.
It is not invalid, however.
(For example, it is not dropped from the CSSOM.)

Processing ''@apply'' Rules {#processing}
=========================================

To process ''@apply'' rules:

1. Inherit as normal.
2. Do var() substitution into custom properties only.
3. Do @apply substitution.
4. Re-do var() substitutions based on new property info.




CSSOM {#cssom}
==============

<pre class=idl>
interface CSSApplyRule : CSSRule {
	attribute DOMString referencedProperty;
};
</pre>

<dl dfn-for="CSSApplyRule">
	<dt><dfn attribute>referencedProperty</dfn>
	<dd>
		The custom property that the ''@apply'' rule is referencing.

		Upon setting, if the value is not a valid <<custom-property-name>>,
		ignore the set and <a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}}.
</dl>

Issue: Also, switch {{CSSStyleRule}} to inherit from {{CSSGroupingRule}}.
